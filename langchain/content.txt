A variable is a symbol, often a letter like x, y, or z, that represents an unknown value. 
Algebraic expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators. 
For instance, in the expression 3x + 4, x is the variable. 
To evaluate such expressions, substitute specific values for the variables and perform the arithmetic operations 
following the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: 
Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), 
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). For example, to evaluate 3x + 4 for x = 2, 
substitute 2 for x to get 3(2) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.


Linear equations are equations of the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are constants. 
To solve such equations, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. 
For example, to solve 2x + 3 = 7, subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 4, and then divide 
both sides by 2 to find x = 2.

Multi-step equations require more complex procedures. For instance, to solve 3(x - 4) + 5 = 16, 
first distribute the 3 to get 3x - 12 + 5 = 16. Combine like terms to obtain 3x - 7 = 16, then 
add 7 to both sides to get 3x = 23, and finally divide by 3 to find x = 23/3.

In real-world applications, students set up equations based on given problems and solve them 
to find unknown values. For example, if a movie ticket costs 8 dollars and you have 50 dollars, 
the equation 8x = 50 represents the maximum number of tickets x you can buy. Solving this gives
 x = 50/8 = 6.25, so you can buy up to 6 tickets.


Graphing linear equations involves plotting them on the Cartesian coordinate plane, 
which consists of the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) intersecting at the 
origin (0, 0). A linear equation can be written in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, 
where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept. The slope m indicates the 
steepness of the line, and the y-intercept b is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example, to graph the equation y = 2x + 3, start by plotting the y-intercept (0, 3). 
Then use the slope 2 (which means rise over run) to find another point. From (0, 3), rise 2 units 
up and run 1 unit to the right to plot the point (1, 5). Draw a line through these points to complete the graph.

The slope of a line is calculated as the ratio of the change in y to the change in x between two 
points on the line. If you have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). 
For example, for points (1, 2) and (3, 4), the slope is (4 - 2) / (3 - 1) = 2 / 2 = 1.


To write linear equations, use the slope-intercept form y = mx + b or the point-slope form y - y1 =
 m(x - x1). For example, to write the equation of a line with a slope of 3 passing through the point 
 (2, 4), use the point-slope form: y - 4 = 3(x - 2). This simplifies to y = 3x - 2.


Systems of linear equations involve solving multiple equations simultaneously. The solutions to these 
systems are the points where the lines intersect. Methods for solving systems include graphing, substitution, 
and elimination.

To solve by graphing, plot each equation on the coordinate plane and find the intersection point. For 
substitution, solve one equation for one variable and substitute this expression into the other equation.
 For elimination, add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the remaining variable.

Inequalities express relationships where one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another. 
For example, to solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 7, subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x > 4, then divide by 2 to find x > 2.

When graphing inequalities on a number line, use open circles for < or > and closed circles for ≤ or 
≥. For example, x > 2 is represented by a number line with an open circle at 2 and shading to the right.

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. 
For equations involving absolute value, solve by considering the positive and negative cases. For example, 
to solve |x| = 5, set up two equations: x = 5 and x = -5. The solutions are x = 5 and x = -5.


Exponents represent repeated multiplication. For instance, 2^3 means 2 multiplied by itself three times,
 which equals 8. The laws of exponents include the product rule (a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)), the quotient rule
  (a^m / a^n = a^(m-n)), and the power rule ((a^m)^n = a^(m*n)). Simplify expressions using these rules 
  to handle complex problems involving exponents.


Polynomials are algebraic expressions with terms that are added or subtracted. Each term consists of a 
constant and variables raised to non-negative integer powers. Students classify polynomials by degree 
(highest power) and the number of terms (monomial, binomial, trinomial). For example, 4x^2 + 3x - 7 is
 a quadratic polynomial because the highest power of x is 2.

Factoring involves writing a polynomial as a product of its factors. Methods include factoring out 
the greatest common factor (GCF), factoring by grouping, and factoring trinomials. For example, to 
factor x^2 + 5x + 6, find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3, 
so the factors are (x + 2)(x + 3).

Quadratic equations are of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve these equations, use factoring, 
completing the square, or the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a). For example, to 
solve x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0, factor the polynomial to get (x + 5)(x - 1) = 0. Setting each factor to 
zero gives the solutions x = -5 and x = 1.

Functions describe relationships where each input corresponds to exactly one output. Functions 
are often represented by equations like f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1. To evaluate a function, substitute 
a value for x. For example, if f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 and x = 3, then f(3) = 3^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16.


Radicals involve roots of numbers, such as square roots and cube roots. To simplify expressions 
with radicals, use the properties of radicals. For example, √(25) = 5. When simplifying expressions 
like √(18), factor 18 into 9 * 2, so √(18) = √(9 * 2) = √(9) * √(2) = 3√(2).


Rational expressions are fractions with polynomials in the numerator and denominator. Simplify 
rational expressions by factoring and reducing. For instance, to simplify (x^2 - 4) / (x^2 - 2x), 
factor the numerator and denominator: (x - 2)(x + 2) / x(x - 2). Cancel the common factor (x - 2) 
to get (x + 2) / x.

Graphing inequalities involves shading the region on the coordinate plane that satisfies the inequality. 
For linear inequalities like y > 2x + 1, graph the line y = 2x + 1, then shade above the line to represent
the area where y is greater than 2x + 1.


Coordinate geometry uses algebra to solve problems related to geometric shapes on the coordinate plane. 
Important formulas include the distance formula d = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), which calculates the 
distance between two points, and the midpoint formula ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2), which finds the 
midpoint of a line segment.

Factoring Polynomials: Writing a polynomial as a product of its factors. Methods include factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) and factoring by grouping.

Greatest Common Factor (GCF): The largest factor that divides each term in a polynomial. For example, the GCF of 4x^3 and 6x^2 is 2x^2. Factor out the GCF from the polynomial to simplify.

Factoring by Grouping: Group terms with common factors and factor out the GCF from each group. For example, factor 3x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x - 2 by grouping as (3x^2(x + 1) - 2(x + 1)) to get (3x^2 - 2)(x + 1).

Factoring Trinomials: Write trinomials in the form ax^2 + bx + c as a product of two binomials. For example, factor x^2 + 5x + 6 by finding two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5, which are 2 and 3. Thus, x^2 + 5x + 6 factors to (x + 2)(x + 3).

Quadratic Equations: Equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Solve using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

Quotient Rule: d/dx [u(x) / v(x)] = (v(x) * u'(x) - u(x) * v'(x)) / (v(x))^2. Used to differentiate a function that is the quotient of two functions. For example, d/dx [x / sin(x)] = (sin(x) * 1 - x * cos(x)) / (sin(x))^2.

Chain Rule: d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x). Used to differentiate a composition of functions. For example, if f(x) = (3x + 2)^4, then d/dx [f(x)] = 4 * (3x + 2)^3 * 3.
